# morseCodeTranslator
a python module that builds a populated binary tree for morse code values, with a method to easily translate a morse code string to its letter.

This weekend I had some amazing whiteboarding practice with [GirlDevelopIt](https://twitter.com/gdisf) SF (highly recommend!)

One of the challenges gave the coder a working binary tree full of all the correct morse code letter positions, which we then had to use to solve a problem.  

So, at home I built this little module that would let anyone have a working morse code binary tree to play with for their own challenges. (I also built out the leter translate method which was part of our whiteboarding work too.)

Have fun!  Binary trees are trippy!

what a morse code binary tree looks like:

CHALLENGE:  Given an array of strings (each string is "."s and "-"s representing a valid morse code value) return the English text that the array translates to.

(one whole word, no spaces.)
